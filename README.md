# Repository Structure

This repository is organized to provide comprehensive coverage of data structures and algorithms, along with practical problem-solving examples. The structure of the repository is as follows:

## Algorithms (`Algos` Folder)

The `Algos` folder contains various algorithm types, each with its own subfolder structure:

### Algorithm Type 1

- **Implementation (`Implementation` Folder)**: This subfolder contains detailed explanations and code implementations for Algorithm Type 1. You can explore how to implement this algorithm from scratch.

- **Solved Problems (`Solved Problems` Folder)**: In this subfolder, you will find solutions to various problems that demonstrate the practical application of Algorithm Type 1.

### Algorithm Type 2

- **Implementation (`Implementation` Folder)**: Similar to Algorithm Type 1, this subfolder provides implementations and explanations for Algorithm Type 2.

- **Solved Problems (`Solved Problems` Folder)**: Here, you can find solved problems related to Algorithm Type 2.

### ...

(Repeat this structure for each algorithm type)

## Data Structures (`Data Structures` Folder)

The `Data Structures` folder follows a similar structure as the `Algos` folder, with individual subfolders for different types of data structures:

### Data Structure Type 1

- **Implementation (`Implementation` Folder)**: This subfolder contains detailed explanations and code implementations for Data Structure Type 1. You can learn how to create and use this data structure.

- **Solved Problems (`Solved Problems` Folder)**: In this subfolder, you will find solved problems that showcase the practical usage of Data Structure Type 1.

### Data Structure Type 2

- **Implementation (`Implementation` Folder)**: Just like Data Structure Type 1, this subfolder provides implementations and explanations for Data Structure Type 2.

- **Solved Problems (`Solved Problems` Folder)**: Here, you can explore solved problems related to Data Structure Type 2.
